# macOS Preferences

Small list of preferences, I'll update the list as soon as I learn how to make nice scripts.

```MAKEFILE
git clone https://github.com/maxencejded/macOS.git ~/.macOS
```

## Automatic Mode
```MAKEFILE
sh .macOS/script.sh
```
After go to iTerm > Preferences > Profils and change the Colors Dracula and the Text > Font by `14pt
Roboto Mono for Powerline`
