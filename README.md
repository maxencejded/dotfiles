# macOS Preferences

Small list of preferences, I'll update the list as soon as I learn how to make nice scripts.

## Vim

Copy on the main directory `~`. Then run the following commands :
```MAKEFILE
mv .vimrc .vimr_old # Backup your old vimrc
mv vim .vim
ln -s vim/.vimrc .vimrc
```

## Zshrc
Copy on the main directory `~`. Then run the following commands :
```MAKEFILE
mv .zshrc .zshrc_old
mv zshrc .zshrc
```
